Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their n -page book to page number p. Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number 1) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number n), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p.

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the number of pages in the book.
The second line contains an integer,p , denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to. 

print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn to get to page p.

Sandy likes palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, madam is a palindrome.

On her 7th birthday, Sandy's uncle, Richie Rich, offered her an n-digit check which she refused because the number was not a palindrome. Richie then challenged Sandy to make the number palindromic by changing no more than k digits. Sandy can only change 1 digit at a time, and cannot add digits to (or remove digits from) the number.


Given k and an n-digit number, help Sandy determine the largest possible number she can make by changing <= k digits.

Note: Treat the integers as numeric strings. Leading zeros are permitted and can't be ignored (So 0011 is not a palindrome, 0110 is a valid palindrome). A digit can be modified more than once.

Input format:
The first line contains two space-separated integers, n (the number of digits in the number) and  (the maximum number of digits that can be altered), respectively. 

The second line contains an n-digit string of numbers that Sandy must attempt to make palindromic.

output format
Print a single line with the largest number that can be made by changing no more than  digits; if this is not possible, print -1.

Palindromes are strings that read the same from the left or right, for example madam or 0110.

You will be given a string representation of a number and a maximum number of changes you can make. Alter the string, one digit at a time, to create the string representation of the largest number possible given the limit to the number of changes. The length of the string may not be altered, so you must consider 0's left of all higher digits in your tests. For example 0110 is valid, 0011 is not.

Given a string representing the starting number and a maximum number of changes allowed, create the largest palindromic string of digits possible or the string -1 if it's impossible to create a palindrome under the contstraints.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, n (the number of digits in the number) and k (the maximum number of changes allowed), respectively.
The second line contains an -digit string of numbers that you are to attempt to make palindromic.


Print a single line with the largest number that can be made by changing no more than digits; if this is not possible, print -1.
